  "summary": "The company registration submission exhibits significant non-compliance issues related to jurisdiction adherence, document completeness, clarity of legal language, and formatting. Key deficiencies include a stated preference for non-ADGM jurisdiction, ambiguous company activity descriptions, missing critical clauses (e.g., AML, data protection), and incomplete or improperly formatted signatory and resolution sections. These issues would likely prevent successful registration without comprehensive rectification.",
